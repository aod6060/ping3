# Ping3

Ping 3 is a small pong clone. I'm going to use this pong clone to test my 
little build system called [dsbs](https://github.com/aod6060/dsbs).

Check it out if you want a simple build system that doesn't use makefiles
as it base so lets talk about Ping3. Ping3 is a pong clone. The previous 2
games came out in the late 2000s which I lost the source code for them. So
after all these years I decided to do a small remake because the 2 original were created on linux. It fealt like the right thing to do. This 
game will be open source using the good old mit license so go ahead and look at the source code.
